## About

I wanted to see how ncurses programs work so decided to write my own Tetris using C. As it turned out, ncurses was very easy to use and the documentation was very helpful. Tetris, however is surprisingly complex game and most of the time went to writing the game logic.

Anyways, the end result was pretty reasonable and the game is pretty close to the real deal.
